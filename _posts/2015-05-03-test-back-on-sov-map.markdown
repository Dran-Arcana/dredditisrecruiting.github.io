At 14:30 EVE time today, TEST Alliance Please Ignore officially retook its
place as a strong, independent sovereignty-holding alliance whose presence
cannot be denied.

TEST staging immediately broke out with chants of *TEST #1* and 
*STRANGE FLEETS WILL HAPPEN HERE* as festival launchers lit the sky all over
fortress J-9M7D.

Growing strongly in both members and skill since its departure from HERO coalition, 
TEST Alliance is the first and original reddit-based, newbie-friendly alliance, 
with years of sovereignty, nullsec warfare, and leadership experience.
