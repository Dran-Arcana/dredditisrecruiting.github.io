Two weeks after [declaring holy war upon the Brave Collective](
{% post_url 2015-06-23-dreddit-deploying-to-fountain-to-avenge-lost-flair %})
and drinking the sweet, sweet nectar of Boonie Tears&trade;, zKillboard 
officials presented Dreddit CEO DurrHurrDurr with the fabled Golden Salt
Shaker, the symbolic award given to the most active, elite PvP corps in New
Eden.

Working together with best Alliance bros _Jump Drive Appreciation Society_ and
_Star Frontiers_, TEST Alliance Please Ignore is now officially the most active
PvP alliance in the game.
