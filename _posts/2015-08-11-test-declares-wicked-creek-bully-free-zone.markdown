At 8:30 PM this evening, TEST's little brother and Wicked Creek co-habitant RANE 
came home from school in tears with a fresh black eye. After running 
past older brother and TEST CEO Sapporo Jones whimpering, Jones grew enraged.

This is not the first time RANE has come home with a bruise. For the
past two weeks, local bullies at the Phoebe Free Highschool have been picking
on TEST's little brother. With gangs multiple times the amount of active RANE
pilots, PFR gangs would reinforce RANE assets while taunting the young
alliance. "We just want fights, little RANE. Come out to play", they would say
while shoving the little guy into his locker repeatedly.

At first big bro TEST would just help clean him up and tell his little brother
to stand up to them. They talked to the principal at Phoebe Free
Highschool - apparently it was just some "rogue" students looking for fights.

Then TEST saw something. The principal claiming it was just a 'couple' students
was actually there, egging them on. When the principal helped take RANE's lunch
money, TEST grew enraged.

The war drums were sounded. There would be no more bullying.

TEST marched straight into Phoebe capital 4-CM8I, shouting loudly "**PICK ON 
SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE!**" Fleet commanders Trafalgar Raw 
and Sajuuk Thanatoskhar immediately locked down the entire system, establishing
a deadzone on the station. Ratters and miners that didn't dock up fast 
enough were tracked down and beaten to a pulp.

Bubbles were anchored. Entosis modules were activated.

The bully tried feebly to swing back. As TEST alliance chanted "WE JUST WANT 
FIGHTS!", missile launchers and artillary cannons reduced the PFR fleet to 
capsules in under sixty seconds - with no losses.

As the nearby Jump Bridge was crumbling under shot after shot of band-sawed
1400mm artillary, TEST's intelligence, recon, and capital
commanders finished drawing up a prioritized list of the bully's assets to
destroy.

As the ping for dreadnaughts was about to go out and all sovereignty structures
in their capital entered reinforced mode, the cry finally came.

## Uncle! Uncle!

Lessons were learned.

There's no place for bullies in Wicked Creek.
