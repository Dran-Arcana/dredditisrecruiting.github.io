At 14:30 today, federal agents from the TEST Drug Enforcement Agency launched
a massive raid on the home of the infamous [BLUEFUX cartel](http://dredditisrecruiting.com/2015/04/15/the-eye-of-the-dino-turns-to-blue.html).

Shortly after the seizure, TEST DEA field commander Grega Oriki issued a press
statement.

> Possessing moon goo is a serious crime. Without proper handling and
> safety precautions, impressionable low-skill, low-experienced capsuleers might 
> fall into a goo-induced hallucination where they actually succeed against 
> fleets the size of their entire alliance.
>
> Under the guidelines layed out in Article 4, Section 2.0(b-i) of the 
> DurrHurrDurr Goo Protection Act, I instructed officers of the TEST Drug 
> Enforcement to raid the headquarters of the most notorious gang of illegal goo
> distributors in the region, the BLUEFUX cartel.
>
> Shortly after taking control of the station, we uncovered evidence of
> large, organized illegal goo distribution, large stockpiles of weapons
> (mysteriously priced at over 5,000% of their Jita value), and liberated an
> entire hangar full of Exotic Dancers, who appear to have been kept against
> their will as some sick form of entertainment.

The seized goo was immediately photographed, processed for prints, and 
turned over to DurrHurrDurr, administrator of the TEST Center for Moon Goo
Control.

The station was strangely abandoned, and uncaptured BLUEFUX gang members are 
rumored to have fled to the highlands of 1L-OEK, a freeport under the control of TEST allies 
SLYCE. 

How this works out for them remains to be seen.
