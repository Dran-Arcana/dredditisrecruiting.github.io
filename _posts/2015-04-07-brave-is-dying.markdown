If you haven't been following the drama lately, there has been a coup in the Brave Collective. Several members of the alliance's leadership team, using the game's Alliance executor voting mechanic, successsfully [ousted CEO Lychton Kondur](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bravenewbies/comments/31m3a1/brave_leadership_is_changing/) after he went to bed. In the hours that have followed, a massive outpouring of confusion and dissent from within and without is threatening to tear the Collective apart. Line members and leadership that were kept in the dark feel blindsided, and are furious.

All eyes are on BRAVE right now, from Deklein to Immensea.

Over the next few days, you're going to see a million comments, articles, and videos trying to explain why. If you want a post-revolution analysis, I highly recommend [Elise Randolph's](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/31lp7s/catch_a_tale_of_two_braves_a_retrospective_from/) explanation of the fall of Catch and [DurrHurrDurr's](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/31shy5/dreddit_ceo_update_space_revolution_edition/) perspective on BRAVE. 

This isn't a retrospective. Rather, a simple assurance. You have plenty of places to go. Corporations and alliances come and go all the time - what matters is the friends you made in those alliances. 

## There has never been a better time to be a newbie in New Eden.

Brave grew not just because it took in newbies, but because it was the core of their identity. And they were loud and proud about it.

Fast forward two years, and Brave's legacy is felt everywhere. For all its shortcomings, BRAVE was successful in its mission.

**All the major blocs want newbies** in some way or another.

* TEST recruits newbies.
* The CFC recruits newbies. 
* ProviBloc recruits newbies.
* N3 recruits newbies.
* PL recruits newbies.
* BL recruits newbies
* Rus recruits newbies.

The only thing that's changing is whether or not there's an alliance with the word "newbie" in the name.

Rather than being a catch-all, each of these powers maintain their own culture beyond the newbie identity. GoonSwarm and Test are people from online communities that just want to hang out together and have fun. BL and PL are pilots that do that same thing, but especially love the highest ends of PvP gameplay, and each with their own unique cultural spins. 

Believe it or not **there are some really cool people** in every single one of those alliances. Even the people shooting GE-8JV's station with a super carrier.

## Don't fret. No one is going anywhere.

The people you met and the friends you make in the alliances you join will still be there, regardless of which flag you currently stand under. 

Many of the Pandemic Legion pilots in Catch were once TEST members. Black Legion nearly **headshot TEST's home** two weeks ago, before the Pandemic Legion members we were **just fighting** came to help save it. And hours later there were Black Legion pilots in our comms hanging out and laughing it up.

EVE is small. Shockingly small, although it may not always seem like it.

Today's news might be scary to you if you've only ever known Brave, but we can all assure you that you'll always have a place to fly in New Eden.

## Yes, Dreddit is recruiting.

Although reminding everyone constantly is a running joke in our culture, we really are recruiting. If you've been in Brave 30 days or longer and are active, feel free to hit us up in _"Dreddit Recruitment"_ in-game.

**Everyone loves newbros.**
