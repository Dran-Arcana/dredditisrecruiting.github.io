**CURSE** At 22:15 EVE time today, TEST Alliance strat FC Trafalgar Raw called
"align to broadcast", pressed fleet warp, and every single person in the 78-man
fleet immediately entered warp. This monumental occasion is the first time TEST
has ever completed a full fleet warp with every member aligned in its 5 year
history.

Privately, in the skype channel of the Swagtron/Raw Conspiracy to Make Test
Not Shit, conspirators cried _"Holy shit. We actually did it"_ as tears were
shed.
