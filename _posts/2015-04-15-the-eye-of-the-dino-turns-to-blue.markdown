Having steamrolled its most egregious wannabe-headshotter NOFUX, TEST Alliance CEO Sapporo Jones issued an internal memo this afternoon outlining the next source of blood to be fed into The Creek.

> With some childish glee I would like to inform you that war is upon us again.  
>
> The players in this war are different than the types we have typically fought in the past.  Where there was organization and structure in our enemies before, some level of skill and understanding of game mechanics, there isn't now.  Our enemies have organized together in to the most haphazard coalition I've ever seen in this game.  
>
> This new coalition, dubbed BLUEFux, is comprised of BLUE Alliance (kek), ex-N0fux (they haven't learned yet), Sugar. (ex-CFC who were allies during our time in HERO and who are mad we wouldn't form a coalition with them again here in Wicked Creek), Diplomatic Immunity (they have a good blogger and like 5 active dudes), Hell's Pirates (proud owners of famous ex-TEST pets NFHP) and of course CORVUS (the tryhard shit tier mercs RADRF hired).  
>
> If these names frighten you, you should probably go back to high sec.
>
> These folks have banded together in the name of pushing us out in USTZ.  They remember an anemic TEST, a TEST that didn't give two shits about what happened around them because their interests weren't really tied to the coalition's interests.  What they will find when they get organized and ready is a TEST possibly stronger than during any other stand alone campaign in our history.  

TEST Alliance pilots were eager to answer the call, with fleets have already been sighted on the undock of Q-GQHN. TEST agents inside BLUE have reported difficulty accessing station services there.

Dreddit recruiter and shitposter Yolo Swagtron emphasized that _"our intelligence, recon, covert ops, and fleet commander recruitment numbers are all at an all-time high. **We couldn't be happier to welcome new targets.**"_
