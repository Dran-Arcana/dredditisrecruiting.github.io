**WICKED CREEK** In a moment of divine providence that shows the Light of his
Durrness shines upon us all, most competent and skilled Imperium Bloc-level FC
*Vily* was found roaming aimlessly through the Creek. 

Seeing he had lost his badge of the most evil swarm of the Goon (hats be upon
them), a faithful HR Director did pray unto His Durrness: "FC wut do?"

Thus spoke the Durr: 

> **"TELL HIM DREDDIT IS RECRUITING!"**

And so it came to pass that a bloc level FC of the Imperium did join the
Dreddit, and the Autism did wash over him.
