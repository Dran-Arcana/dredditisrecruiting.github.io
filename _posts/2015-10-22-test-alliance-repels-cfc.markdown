**WICKED CREEK** In a dramatic victory for TEST Alliance, Imperium’s deployment
group was roundly defeated in battle in system M-MBRT in Wicked Creek.
Outnumbering the TEST fleet and engaging them in T3 Cruisers with HAC support,
the Imperium Tengus were no match against the mighty T3ST Proteus Doctrine. In
a dramatic victory for TEST Alliance, Imperium’s deployment group was roundly
defeated in battle in system M-MBRT in Wicked Creek. Outnumbering the TEST
fleet and engaging them in T3 Cruisers with HAC support, the Imperium Tengus
were [no
match](http://evf-eve.com/services/brcat/?s=591&b=6734999&e=90&t=urqb&r=1) 
against the mighty T3ST Proteus Doctrine.

In a move variously called “The Trafalgar Shuffle”, “The Trafalgar Hammer”, and
widely recognized as “The Old In and Out”, TEST FC Trafalgar Raw landed the
Protes within easy reach of the Tengus, who for their part were busy trying to
run away: trying and failing to warp off due to “CCP suddenly disengaging our
warp drives,” according to the Imperium FC in a report smuggled to us by way of
several spies. After giving the Imperium forces The Old In and Out, Trafalgar
and TEST forces retired to U-HVIX, the capital of Wicked Creek, to play a fine
game of Bacon Bar Political Debate.

Imperium forces suffered 18.4 billion in losses in this humiliation, losses
widely acknowledged by the Imperium as _“already paid for”_ with many of the
capsuleers present on the Imperium side adding _“didn’t want that Tengu
anyways.”_
