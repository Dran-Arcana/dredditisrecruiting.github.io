At 6:30 AM this morning, the TEST Alliance /r/bravenewbies flair was found face
down in a puddle in a back alley of the YZ-LQL station. After being rushed to
a nearby hospital, it was pronounced dead on arrival at 6:59 local time.

Dreddit CEO DurrHurrDurr has declared a corporate day of mourning as a wave of 
anti-BRAVE unrest and protests swept through Wicked Creek.

This evening, Mr. HurrDurr then announced that Dreddit is forming a new,
hyper-elite sperg force to avenge the murdered flair.

> Pandemic Legion works with supercapitals and pilot skill as an art. 
> 
> Black Legion with tech three cruisers and superb fleet commanders.

> We will avenge the unprovoked, barbaric murder of our bravenewbies flair.

Rumors abound that the Spooky Ghost of Deklein himself, Sa Matra, is departing
from Fidelas Constantbad space at this very moment to haunt the stars of
F-88PJ. Upon learning of Sir Matra's movement, Dreddit economic Hebrew Yolo 
Swagtron advised all members of Test Alliance to invest in Vexor Navy Issues, 
Ishtars, and Gilas in the Fountain region in anticipation of a coming drastic 
spike in demand for those hulls.
