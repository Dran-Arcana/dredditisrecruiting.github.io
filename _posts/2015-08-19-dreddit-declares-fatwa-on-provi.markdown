Dreddit is moving to attack ProviBloc.


> Gentlemen, mi'ladies, bronies, owlkin, and other esteemed autists.

> Once upon a time, some dear friends came to live with us in the Creek. You may have known them as Dirt n Glitter.
>
> But I, I my friends, knew them by another name: the people who brought meaning into my life. During their missionary work with us, I was enlightened. Turned to the light of the one true Empress of Amarr, Ke$ha Rose I.
>
> It has come to my attention that there are corporations that do not recognize Her Majesty's glittery, drunken rule over Amarr and its domains.
>
> These blasphemers must be punished for unironically writing things like this post. Dreddit, the 1,700-strong Autist Legion and Hammer of TEST, will answer the call.
>
> We will deploy our Rifter Horde to the shores of Providence, and tear down their temples to sobriety and other boring bullshit, leaving only wrecks and empty Jack Daniels bottles in our wake.
>
> May the Light of the Spectrum guide us,
>
> Yolo Swagtron, Dreddit Second-in-Autism
