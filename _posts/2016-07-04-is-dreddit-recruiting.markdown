Top Dreddit engineers today have launched a fully
RESTful, WebScale™, MongoDB-powered API solution to answer the age-old question: *Is
Dreddit recruiting?*

Available at
[www.isdredditrecruiting.com](https://www.isdredditrecruiting.com), the
Dreddit Recruitment API consults a myriad of databases and algorithms, going
through a full web-scale architecture stack to determine the recruitment status
of _Dreddit_ - an elite, highly-exclusive EVE Online corporation.

A full JavaScript SDK is available to all developers, for live, programmatic
updates on Dreddit's recruitment status, via bower. 

```
bower install dreddit-recruitment-sdk
```

When asked why MongoDB was chosen, the Engineering team replied:

> [MongoDB is Web Scale. MongoDB is the
> Future.](http://www.mongodb-is-web-scale.com/)
> 
> [Relational Databases weren't build for web scale. MongoDB handles web
> scale.
> You turn it on and it scales right
> up.](http://www.mongodb-is-web-scale.com/)
